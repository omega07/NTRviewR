# edoC-Editor
A code Editor with multiple language and theme support. Created using ReactJS from scratch, hence used webpack and babel for the obvious and NodeJS for serving the application and handling the request from user to compile and run the code. It is a client-side rendered application.
<br>
**To run the application locally:**<br>
-> clone the repository <br>
-> cd "repo_name" <br>
-> npm install<br>
-> npm start<br>

"npm start" will start a local server at http://localhost:8000.<br>

**Included The .env File Intentionally**
