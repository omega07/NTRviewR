# edoC-Editor
A code Editor with multiple language and theme support. Created using ReactJS from scratch, hence used webpack and babel for the obvious and NodeJS for serving the application. It is a client-side rendered application.
<br>
**To run the application locally:**<br>
-> clone the repository <br>
-> cd "repo_name" <br>
-> npm install<br>
-> npm start<br>

"npm start" will start a local server at http://localhost:8000.<br>

**Included The .env File Intentionally**
